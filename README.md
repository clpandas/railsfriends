# Friends Last App

Hello my name is Crystal Lor and this is my second introdution to making a Ruby on Rails project. My first introduction being the blog app covered in the official Rails Guides. 

The "Learn Ruby on Rails - Full Course" offered by freeCodeCamp via YouTube and taught by John Elder from Codemy.com is 3 years old. Given the nature of this industry, there were a couple hiccups following the tutorial to a T. Fortuntately, the experience was aided by gracious strangers from old YouTube comments as well as through the occasional Google search. In a way, I am glad the process was not smooth because I imagine the reality of the software engineering process as well as web development will not be smooth.

Happy to learn :)
